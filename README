No, this is no complete xdebug implementation and it will never be one.

This tries to be a quick and dirty hack to get some of my jobs done without
always firing up Eclipse

dependencies:
  - see vim-addon-xdebug-addon-info.txt
  - socat

http://url?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=ECLIPSE_DBGP&KEY=12894211795611

HOWTO:
============
1) make sure vim-addon-async works (compile the c helper application)

2) :XDbgStart

3) open web page such as
  http://url?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=ECLIPSE_DBGP&KEY=12894211795611

4) call g:xdebug.ctx.send('step_into')

  (Vim crashes soon :-( )
  It seems to crash less often when switching syn off! ??

  See plugin/xdebug.vim to see that Eclipse standard mappings have are used by
  default.

  XDbgStack works (current stack is feed to quickfix)

TODO:
====
- Help me make this all more mature / complete
  * inspect vars (stack level!)
  * exec code
  * break points
  base64 encoding has been implemented in webapi-vim
- implement things like "goto cursor" (there is a temporary breakpoint command)
- ...

This is the protocol documentation I found:
- http://xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php
- The messages sent by PDT (Eclipse) can be debugged easily.
