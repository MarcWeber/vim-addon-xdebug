No, this is no complete xdebug implementation and it will never be one.

This tries to be a quick and dirty hack to get some of my jobs done without
always firing up Eclipse

dependencies:
  - see vim-addon-xdebug-addon-info.txt
  - socat

http://url?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=ECLIPSE_DBGP&KEY=12894211795611

HOWTO:
============
1) make sure vim-addon-async works (compile the c helper application)

2) :XDbgStart

3) open web page such as
  http://url?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=ECLIPSE_DBGP&KEY=12894211795611

4) call g:xdebug.ctx.send('step_into')

  (Vim crashes soon :-( )
  It seems to crash less often when switching syn off! ??

  See plugin/xdebug.vim to see that Eclipse standard mappings have are used by
  default.

  XDbgStack works (current stack is feed to quickfix)

  Eg this prints the contents of $_GET
  call xdebug#Eval('$_GET')

5) watching vars:
  manually: call xdebug#Eval('$_GET')

  more convenient:
  XDbgVarView opens a buffer. Add lines like this:

    watch $_GET
    watch $_POST['foo']

  use :UpdateWatchView to update the buffer.
  This will be done automatically on stepping.

  You can visually select lines and press <cr> to execute arbitrary PHP code

6) breakpoints
  XDbgBreakPoints opens a window. You add breakpoints by adding lines (the way shown below the marker)
  then pressing enter. Some more porcelaine is missing!

  As alterntavie press F9 or use the XDbgToggleLineBreakpoint command

  :-) Most of the breakpoint types are not supported by xdebug?

  " Add to your .vimrc to enable breakpoint on first line.
  let g:xdebug = {'stop_on_first_line': 1}

7) xdebug port (defaults to 9000):
  Either call fun! xdebug#Start({'port':9001})
  or set it in your .vimrc:
  let g:xdebug.opts = { 'port' : 9001 }

TODO:
====
- Help me make this all more mature / complete
  * inspect vars (stack level!)
  * exec code
  * break points
  base64 encoding has been implemented in webapi-vim
- implement things like "goto cursor" (there is a temporary breakpoint command)
- ...

This is the protocol documentation I found:
- http://xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php
- The messages sent by PDT (Eclipse) can be debugged easily.

Note
====
This plugin has enough features for everyday work now.
If you want more let me know.

Thanks TO
===========
mattn (github) who wrote the nice XML parsing library which also contains the
bas64 enc/decoding
